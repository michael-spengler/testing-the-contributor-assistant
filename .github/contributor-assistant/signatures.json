If a contributor wants to develop things into a different direction than I, the corresponding contributor can do this in his own repository. \n\n## Fairness\n\nEach contributor should have the best of intentions when it comes to fairness and mutual support.\n"}},{"type":"checkboxes","id":"signature","attributes":{"label":"Signature","options":[{"label":"I have read the Contributor Document and I hereby sign this document.","required":true}]},"validations":{"required":true}}]},"signatures":[{"user":{"databaseId":8480657,"login":"KharitonOff"},"owner":"michael-spengler","repo":"testing-the-contributor-assistant","issue":3,"date":"2021-07-27T08:34:29.625Z","fields":[[true]]}]},"previous":[],"invalidated":[]}}
